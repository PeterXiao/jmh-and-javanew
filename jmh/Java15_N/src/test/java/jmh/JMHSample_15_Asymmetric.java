     * So far all the tests were symmetric: the same code was executed in all the threads.
     * At times, you need the asymmetric test. JMH provides this with the notion of @Group,
     * which can bind several methods together, and all the threads are distributed among
     * the test methods.
     *
     * Each execution group contains of one or more threads. Each thread within a particular
     * execution group executes one of @Group-annotated @Benchmark methods. Multiple execution
     * groups may participate in the run. The total thread count in the run is rounded to the
     * execution group size, which will only allow the full execution groups.
     *
     * Note that two state scopes: Scope.Benchmark and Scope.Thread are not covering all
     * the use cases here -- you either share everything in the state, or share nothing.
     * To break this, we have the middle ground Scope.Group, which marks the state to be
     * shared within the execution group, but not among the execution groups.
     *
     * Putting this all together, the example below means:
     *  a) define the execution group "g", with 3 threads executing inc(), and 1 thread
     *     executing get(), 4 threads per group in total;
     *  b) if we run this test case with 4 threads, then we will have a single execution
     *     group. Generally, running with 4*N threads will create N execution groups, etc.;
     *  c) each execution group has one @State instance to share: that is, execution groups
     *     share the counter within the group, but not across the groups.

     *
     * You will have the distinct metrics for inc() and get() from this run.
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ mvn clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_15 -f 1
     *    (we requested single fork; there are also other options, see -h)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
