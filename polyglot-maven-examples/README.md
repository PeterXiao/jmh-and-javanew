# Polyglot for Maven Examples 

This repository serves as a body of working example projects for the supported
Polyglot DSLs and markups.

## Usage

The `master` branch contains the current development branch of the dialect.
Tags for past release are available as well. 

Use the `runAll.sh` script in the top level folder or just run 
`mvn clean install` in any dialect folder you are interested in.

If you want to learn more and potentially improved the examples, take a look
at the tests for the various providers in the 
[polyglot-maven implementation project](https://github.com/takari/polyglot-maven).
