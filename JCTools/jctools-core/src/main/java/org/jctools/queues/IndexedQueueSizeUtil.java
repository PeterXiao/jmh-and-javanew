/**
 * A note to maintainers on index assumptions: in a single threaded world it would seem intuitive to assume:
 * <pre>
 * <code>producerIndex >= consumerIndex</code>
 * </pre>
 * As an invariant, but in a concurrent, long running settings all of the following need to be considered:
 * <ul>
 *     <li> <code>consumerIndex > producerIndex</code> : due to counter overflow (unlikey with longs, but easy to reason)
 *     <li> <code>consumerIndex > producerIndex</code> : due to consumer FastFlow like implementation discovering the
 *     element before the counter is updated.
 *     <li> <code>producerIndex - consumerIndex < 0</code> : due to above.
 *     <li> <code>producerIndex - consumerIndex > Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> : as linked buffers allow constructing queues
 *     with more than <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> elements.
 *
 * </ul>
